# how to write a var

- you can use "var" before the name of the var
ex: var name = 'a name';
- or you can use const for the vars that you dont want to change 
ex: const name = 'a name';
- to write a comment use // for the one line comment or /**/ for more than one line comments
ex:
- // this is comment in one line
- /*this 
	is 
	comment
	in foure lines*/
